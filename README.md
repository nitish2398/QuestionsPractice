Notes
 * In Kruskal sort all the edges by weight and pick the smallest on. And keep on merging the disjoints sets for the vertices in a picked edge.
 * In prims algo start from any node, add all the child and weight to priority queue, sorted by weight. Pick the node with minimum weight and add its child to queue and so on..
